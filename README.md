## Instructions
1. Create a working branch of Master in github.
1. Clone your working branch of UBC-Thunderbots/PCB_Oven to your PC (i.e. C:/Documents/GitHub/PCB_Oven)
2. In Altium Designer, navigate to **Preferences** -> **Data Management** -> **Version Control** and ensure *SVN - Subversion* is enabled and Version 1.9 is selected.
4. In Altium Designer, navigate to **Preferences** -> **Data Management** -> **Design Repositories**.
5. Within **Design Repositories** click on on *Connect To* -> *SVN*.
6. In the dialogue box that comes up, fill in the following information:

Field | Selection/Input
--- | ---
Name | PCB_Oven
Default Checkout Path | *location of the cloned UBC-Thunderbots/PCB_Oven repository (i.e. C:/Documents/GitHub/PCB_Oven)*

After your repository is connected, you can add or remove files like a regular Altium Project folder and then commit them from within Altium Designer by right-clicking on any project files in the **Projects** and hovering the mouse cursor over **Version Control**. After you have finished making changes to your branch, submit a pull request to merge it with Master.
